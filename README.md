# TollBooth-Optimization-

Project that takes in a specific number of manual and automatic lanes of a tollbooth from the user and runs a simulation program that randomly generates several vehicles in the tollbooth with a manual or automatic clarification, timestamp and average amount of time spent by each vehicle in the tollbooth. The program gives the time that takes the next vehicle would take to cross the tollbooth and gives the time accurately up-to 10 decimal places for all the tollbooth lines and analysis about the best configuration to save the time taken .
